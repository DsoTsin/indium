# texturing

A Torus knot with a skybox, based on https://github.com/metal-by-example/sample-code/tree/master/objc/08-CubeMapping.

The only change from the original code (other than translating it to use Indium and C++) is that the original code was designed to run on an iDevice, so it made use of the gyroscope; the translated code uses keyboard and mouse controls.

Controls:
  * W and S - Roll up and down
  * A and D - Pitch left and right
  * Q and E - Yaw counter-clockwise and clockwise
  * Click to toggle Torus knot material between reflective and refractive (default is reflective)
